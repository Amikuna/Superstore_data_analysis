# SampleSuperstore Data Analysis
This is an SQL analysis project that uses the ['SampleSuperstore'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itssuru/super-store) dataset to answer a series of questions about the company's profitability, sales, and cost of products.
# Project Description
This project aims to analyze the 'SampleSuperstore' dataset to help the company determine its profitability and identify areas of improvement. The analysis includes answering the following questions:

* Which is the least profitable state?
* What is the most profitable city?
* Which segment is the least profitable?
* Which category and subcategory are the least profitable?
* Which products sell the most?
* Do certain products have higher discounts?
* What is the cost of products in each subcategory?
* Does the ship mode have any effect on profit?

The analysis reveals that tables, bookcases, and supplies are not profitable for the company, and if the company lowers the discounts or even stops selling them, it can increase its total profit. Moreover, the company can still make a profit with bookcases and supplies if it uses the "Same Day" shipping mode.
Additionally, you can see some [visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amiran.makharadze/viz/SuperStore_16766613466230/Dashboard1) related to this analysis.
